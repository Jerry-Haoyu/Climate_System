# File Organization In The Directory

The basic structure of the directory would be:

    ├── Final_Project
    └── Main
        ├── climate_system_notes.ipynb
        └── README.md 

Where main is the directory for HW and class notes, currently there is only one ipynb file for class notes. 

Remote repo is at:

    origin  https://github.com/Jerry-Haoyu/Climate_System.git
